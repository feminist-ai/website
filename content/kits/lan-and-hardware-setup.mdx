This page is very much a work in progress, more coming next month!

</Infobox>

The high-level requirements are as follows:

- A large computer/server or your own GPU rig (recommended: at least 80G of GPU memory)
- A consumer-grade switch
- 15 ethernet cables and adapters
- Patience in getting it all set up ;)

A deeper step-by-step with photos and instructions is coming -- probably by the end of May 2025!

Watch this space in Fall 2025 for additional instructions on observability and telemetry for AI.
