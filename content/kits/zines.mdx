## Ideas {id="ideas"}

- **Print a zine with contributions by each participant.** Everyone gets to create a spread on a given topic that's combined later on by the host and printed for everyone to keep. You can split the printing costs if needed. Contributions can be digital or scans of pages. Don't forget to create a spread template to ensure each contribution has the correct dimensions.
- **Zines don't have to use pen and paper.** You don't need to be good at drawing to get involved! Instead, you can make a digital zine and use photos, illustrations or fonts.
- **Collect old magazines, newspapers and stickers.** This is the oldschool way of collage making and a lot of fun! It's also a great way to use any tech stickers you might have lying around. Don't forget to provide scissors, glue and paper for the participants.
- **Find out everyone's skills and work together.** During introduction, ask participants to share their skills and interests. Maybe one person loves drawing, while someone else has experience in photo editing or writing. Combine your skills, divide up the tasks and work on the pages together.
- **Zine-ify the documentation of your favourite tool or library.** Zines can help make technical content more fun and accessible. Using existing documentation also gives you plenty of content to work with â€“ see the [spaCy 101](https://explosion.ai/merch) zine for an example.

### Tips for digital zines {id="digital"}

- **You don't need to illustrate from scratch.** There are many free resources for design assets you can use and combine. Instead of working with graphics, you can also focus on colors and fonts. (Don't forget to check the licenses and credit the creators! Your zine could include a page for that at the end.)
- **Approach it like making slides for a talk or presentation.** If you have experience with public speaking, think of a zine spread like a slide. Break down the content into small pieces and illustrate it as needed. [This guide](https://ines.io/blog/beginners-guide-beautiful-slides-talks/) can help if you're a beginner.
- **Upload and share your zine with the world.** [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com) and [Issuu](https://issuu.com) are great for creating digital flipbooks.
