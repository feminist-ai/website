The second Feminist AI LAN party was hosted by [Hessian.AI](https://hessian.ai/) and [PyCon DE](https://2025.pycon.de/) in Darmstadt as a satellite event for PyCon DE from Wednesday, April 23 to Friday, April 25th, 2025.

At the event, many conference and also community participants dropped by to host workshops, connect to the LAN, create zines and documentation and engage with what Feminist AI means.

The event was open to everyone who stands for equality, human rights and feminism. Feminism is for everyone.

There were attendees of many different computer-skills, ages, genders and with/without laptops. Most attendees came from the conference participants, but we did have several groups travel in from the area or pop in from Darmstadt to see what the fuss was about.

At one point, 18 people were connected to the LAN! There were two servers on the LAN -- one serving some of the latest open LLMs that fit on consumer-grade hardware (Llama3 and Ministral8B) for inference tasks and one serving diffusion models (Flux-schnell) via ComfyUI. You can find more details about how to set up your own party hardware in the [hardware guide](/kits/lan-and-hardware-setup)

### Workshops {id="workshops", icon="lightning"}

Here is a small recap of the workshops that were hosted.

Many thanks to everyone who hosted a workshop and left with a cool T-shirt! If you'd like your name and contact details linked to your workshop or contributions, please [send us a GitHub pull request](https://github.com/feminist-ai/website) and consider donating a kit for others to use!

Day One:
- [Hacking LLMs for Feminism](/kits/hacking-llms)
- [Creating representative synthetic data for NLP tasks](https://github.com/feminist-ai/data-development-donations/blob/main/llms/notebooks/ner_ds_generation.ipynb)
- AI-inspired Jewelry

Day Two:
- [Data Development](/kits/data)
- West Coast Swing Music for queer representation
- Feminist Yoga for Pythonistas

Day Three:
- [Hacking Diffusion Models for Feminism](https://github.com/feminist-ai/data-development-donations/tree/main/diffusion)
- Pleasure activism
- How to kick a**! Boxer training for self-confidence

Some that didn't work out due to timing were:
- Creating your own style
- What can men do for feminism? (And can AI help?)
- Building a self-care bot

### Zine making and discussions {id="zine", icon="heart"}

Aside from unconference workshops, there was also a zine making station with letters, markers and magazines donated by participants and organizers.

The zine is published as a [downloadable experience]().

### Thanks {id="thank-you", icon="heart"}

None of this would be possible without the support from [Alexander Herndorf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendorf/) from [PioneersHub](https://pioneershub.de/) who offered to host the space as part of the conference.

[Tereza Iofciu](https://www.terezaiofciu.com/) organized the amazing T-shirts and contributed the yoga workshop and zine, as well as many beautiful pictures in the diffusion workshop.

And of course, to everyone who dropped by, connected locally, created zines and hosted workshops -- a massive thank you and warm hug from the orga-team (and the switch). :)
