The second Feminist AI LAN party will be hosted by [Hessian.AI](https://hessian.ai/) and [PyCon DE](https://2025.pycon.de/) in Darmstadt as a satellite event for PyCon DE from Wednesday, April 23 to Friday, April 25th, 2025.

Since we have a dedicated space provided by the venue at [darmstadium](https://www.darmstadtium.de/) we can create even more community, hackery, art and protest!

This event is open to everyone who stands for equality, human rights and feminism. Feminism is for everyone. There is no computer-skill, age, gender or hardware requirement to join.

We will post an updated schedule here and on [Bluesky]([[BLUESKY]]) as it gets finalized.

### How to find us {id="how-to-find-us", icon="pin"}

Drop by [darmstadium](https://www.darmstadtium.de/) during our open hours. No conference ticket is required to visit the LAN party and the front desk should be able to guide you to our party.

- Wednesday April 23: 11.30am - 4pm
- Thursday April 24: 10am - 4pm
- Friday April 25: 10am - 3pm

### What we have planned {id="plans", icon="check"}

- **Building a FeministLLM**: We are asking for writers, creators, feminists everywhere to contribute texts they feel comfortable and have the rights to contribute for training a Feminist LLM. More information on [how to contribute your text here](https://github.com/feminist-ai/training-feminist-llms/blob/main/README.md#call-for-contributions-for-pyconde).
- **Data Annotation Workshop**: A workshop led by Ines Montani on creating and annotating data with attention to feminist theory and ideas. What would a feminist labeling system look like? Does one exist currently? If not, how do we make one?
- **Hacking LLMs Workshop**: A workshop led by Katharine Jarmul on hacking today's LLMs to attempt to provoke a more feminist response. What actually lurks in these models and what does it tell us about AI, feminism and systems?
- **Zine Making**: Together we want to create a DIY [zine](/kits/zines) covering Feminist AI topics, our hacking experiments, your takeaways from PyCon DE & PyData, and more. You can drop by at any time during the open hours, grab pen, paper and scissors or use your laptop, and contribute!

Want to help? Have a cool idea? Keep reading...

### What we need {id="what-we-need", icon="heart"}

- **Volunteers for setup and hosting**: Are you in Darmstadt or coming to the conference? To have the space open and available as much as possible, we're looking for people who want to come hang out and introduce new folks to the vision and ideas of a Feminist AI LAN Party. If you have an idea, workshop or piece of technology or art you want to share, it would be great for you to host in the space for a part of the conference.
- **Unconference Hosts and Speakers**: We invite both conference participants and others to sign up to lead a conversation, discussion, recite poetry, create zines, make music, ask questions, hack LLMs, demonstrate their research or work within this feminist space. If you already know what you want to show now, [please reach out to coordinate when you can host and present](mailto:[[EMAIL]])!
- **Zine Making Materials**: Do you have old magazines, newspapers, photos or stickers? Feel free to bring them! We'll provide paper, pens, scissors, glue and digital templates.
- **Drop-Ins Welcome**: Bring your art, computer skills, questions and ideas of what Feminist AI means to you at any time during our planned open hours. We'll have art supplies and an area to share your vision of what a feminist and communal AI could look like as part of our space. We welcome your ideas, experiences and questions of all ages, genders and with an intersectional feminist focus.
